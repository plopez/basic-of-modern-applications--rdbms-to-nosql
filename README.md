NoSql DBs are a specific king of Relational DBs { F
}

What is the meaning of ACID ? {
~Anonymization, Cloud, Infrastructure, Decoupling
=Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
~Agnostic, Cloud-first, Infinite, Dual-Band
}

Qualify Relational DB {
~easily scale horizontaly
=are mainly arrays
~are a modern way of storing data
=are still used in modern architectures
}

At a given time, it is easy to reach Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance at once{
F
}

Relational DB focus on {
=Consistency
=Availability
~Partition tolerance
}

NoSql appeared in the late 1990's { F
}

Which of those are NoSql DBs? {
=Document DB
=Key Value DB
~Relationnal DB
~DataWarehouse
=Graph DB
}

NoSQL can store: {
=structured data
=semi-structured data
=unstructured data
}

What are the advantages of NoSQL? {
=they use low commodity hardware
~it supports fully
~all DBs share the same SDK
=they easily scale
~they focus on ACID properties
}

KeyValue DB can be compared to HashTables {T
}

Which NoSQL family Cassandra belongs to? {
~Document DB
~Key Value DB
~Relationnal DB
~Graph DB
=Column DB
}

What is partionning in NoSQL? {
~storing music
=splitting keys on several nodes
~making data redundant to tolerate failure
}

Eventual Consistency means that the consistent state is never reached {F
}

MongoDB can be used to store JSON {T
}

Choose the best DB runtime to handle a cache {
~Document DB
=Key Value DB
~Relationnal DB
~Graph DB
~Column DB
}

Document DB data can never be updated {F
}
